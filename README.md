# README for "Python To Do List"  
*****
A simple to-do list using Python without importing libraries.
Progressive stages of development. I intend to push to this repo as I complete individual parts of the project. Parts will include the very basics like:
Create an empty dictionary to store Tasks.
Add a Task to the dictionary.
Can the Task be marked as done?
Can the Task be Deleted from the dictionary?

The first versions of this project will be text-based and be able to do the following:
> > 1. Add Task to List
> > 2. View full List
> > 3. Mark Task "Done"
> > 4. Delete Task from List

Additional versions will be browser-based. I need to learn how to use HTML and GUI libraries for a better overall user experience.

Unironically, [my search for Markdown formatting](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/writing-github-readme-e593f278a796) led me to a Task List that can be added to GitHub, and it actually looks kind of clean.
- [ ] Make a To Do List or "Task List"
- [ ] Make the check mark function
- [x] put the details as a README on GitHub.

Wish me luck!
